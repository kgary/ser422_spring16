This directory has an example of a full-blown servlet application that was used as Lab 1 for Summer 2020. In the root is a Tomcat 9 and below version, and in the tomcat10 subdirectory there is a Tomcat 10 version of this example. The only difference is the servlet library import statements (from javax to jakarta) and the deployment target for each versin of tomcat I have on my system.
